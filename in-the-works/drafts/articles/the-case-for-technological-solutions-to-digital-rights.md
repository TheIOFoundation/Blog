# The case for technological solutions to Digital Rights

The Case for Technological Solutions to Digital Rights

\
Kuala Lumpur | 16 June 2020

### Background <a href="#c14a2481-131f-4568-9873-c56e1076484b" id="c14a2481-131f-4568-9873-c56e1076484b"></a>

Much has been said about digital rights. From [conceptual frameworks](https://jun-etan.com/documents/Digital-Rights-in-Southeast-Asia-Conceptual-Framework-and-Movement-Building.pdf) to how they apply in real-life situations, we have seen how the conversations evolved from reviewing [the right to digital privacy](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/DigitalAge/Pages/DigitalAgeIndex.aspx), all the way to [dissecting the business models underlying digital platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Age\_of\_Surveillance\_Capitalism). These are all great developments in the discourse of technology and human rights. However, there is something fundamentally missing from these conversations.

\


As I [had been known to say](https://80f16803-0067-4c8c-8069-fd652c0c5032.filesusr.com/ugd/e602f4\_cc40613c4b0547ebb51a196ef545e570.pdf) in the [Singapore Model United Nations](http://singaporemun.org) 2020 that happened just last weekend, if you have a problem with the plumbing system in your house, please call a plumber to fix it. Please do not call a lawyer or a doctor for problems that require the attention of those most familiar with pipes. In that particular MUN assembly, I was role-playing as a diplomat representing the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, debating in the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural (SOCHUM) committee of the United Nations, on a topic very close to heart: digital privacy.&#x20;

\


In hindsight, perhaps I should have just been more direct. Yes, **technologists need to be at the forefront of technology governance**. The press delegate from Russia Today had [misreported my statements](https://80f16803-0067-4c8c-8069-fd652c0c5032.filesusr.com/ugd/e602f4\_cc40613c4b0547ebb51a196ef545e570.pdf) by saying that I had claimed technological solutions should take precedence over social and ethical oversight. Despite the good fun that is an MUN conference, and I do recognise that the reporter was merely staying true in her role-play to the reality of media bias, accountability is not bound by the relativity of space and time. As such, this article is written to fully represent my views on what technological solutions mean and look like (not as a pretend diplomat this time).

### The Missing Conversation <a href="#ec12fadd-d279-4bf0-a9f1-7f5a4a4598eb" id="ec12fadd-d279-4bf0-a9f1-7f5a4a4598eb"></a>

As a solutions-oriented individual, I am naturally  drawn to people who are also similar in focus. Having been in the human rights world for a little over a decade now, my youthful optimism was slowly waning in light of the structural problems that still persist despite the various efforts to address human rights violations. But before the universe would let me succumb to despair, I was redirected to a path I had never dreamed of being on, but certainly glad that I did, and rediscovered my enthusiasm in human rights advocacy.&#x20;

\


It was January 2019 when I was formally introduced to retired technologist and former systems administrator, [Jean F. Queralt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfqueralt/), who had founded [The IO Foundation](http://theiofoundation.org) to address digital rights issues from a technical standards perspective. Though the topic was new to me at the time, I was intrigued by the uniqueness of the discussion and decided not to dismiss it too quickly simply because I did not fully understand it then. Attending that same meeting was technologist and cybersecurity expert, [Isaac Adams](https://linkedin.com/in/anyitomizayi), a good friend and colleague who has been behind a number of [tech products](https://ocg.technology/) globally.

\


Seeing how Isaac understood the concept of technologically configuring human rights compliance into technology architecture and engineering almost immediately after hearing from Jean, I went home to do my own research. As it turns out, there has been plenty of work done on the subject, even though it is not yet mainstream. Coding human rights into software? Who would do that?

\


Well, the [Privacy by Design Foundation](https://privacybydesign.foundation/about/) would, apparently. And they did. [In 2018](https://www.sidn.nl/en/news-and-blogs/sidn-and-privacy-by-design-join-forces-for-privacy-friendly-electronic-identities-based-on-irma), [IRMA (“I Reveal My Attributes”)](https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-en/) was introduced to the market as a tool that technologically protects users’ privacy. It does this by incorporating data minimization into the design of the tech, essentially allowing users to only reveal what is necessary. The [leader of the team behind IRMA](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/id4d-mission-billion/solutions/5625), [Professor Bart Jacobs](https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/bart-jacobs), one of the world’s top cryptologists, was one of the experts invited by TIOF to a program in collaboration with the [Malaysia Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)](https://www.mcmc.gov.my/en/home) in November 2019 to [promote digital rights awareness](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lh0OW\_49eI9FrXmW\_ZRIcIvooWWHcCiZ). I could see how this solution would be practical in national events such as the general elections. In the event that we do adopt electronic voting, technology could configure a way for voters to not have to reveal their exact age, they simply need to prove that they are above 18 years of age (age requirement for voting). With IRMA, voters would have a few less things to worry about with regards to the protection of their voter data.

\


Another technological innovation that came to my attention during research is the technology behind [self-sovereign identities (SSI)](https://medium.com/metadium/introduction-to-self-sovereign-identity-and-its-10-guiding-principles-97c1ba603872). [Kaliya “Identity Woman” Young](https://identitywoman.net/about-kaliya/bio/) has written extensively on the topic. Currently, for most of us, our digital identities are tied to a third party e.g. Google or Facebook. If you have seen how you are able to "Sign Up with Google" or "Sign Up with Facebook", this is an example of how an identity is used to access technology products or services. Let me use an analogy. Without SSI, you are renting a room in someone else's house. With SSI, not only do you own the room, you own the entire house. You will not be subjected to the whims and fancies of your landlord, either Google or Facebook, in case they wish to spy on you, or even kick you out (regardless if you paid the rent or not), and potentially harming you by removing your ability to access services that have been tied to that identity. Just ask yourself this question: what happens if Facebook doesn't exist anymore? If you had used Facebook to sign up to Tinder, for example, if Facebook ever stops existing, you will lose access to that Tinder account. The same applies to all other services that are tied to that Facebook identity.

\


These are only two examples of many with regards to emerging technologies that are designed and built to protect human rights in the digital space, particularly the fundamental human right to privacy. It did not take me long to realise that Jean was on to a game changer here. In the same month, I was on-boarded to TIOF, and thus began applying my social science training to one of 21st century most pertinent socio-political issues, possibly only next to climate change in importance to our generation, and that is one of digital rights.

### Come Back to Reality <a href="#eb29652b-3cad-4b28-b465-f253e75ceb86" id="eb29652b-3cad-4b28-b465-f253e75ceb86"></a>

In all my years of human rights training, there is one principle that has stood true in the test of time, across various contexts and situations. That principle is that **solutions must be based on reality**. A quick example of the application of this principle to my work is [Unveiling Choice (2019)](https://maryamlee.com/unveiling-choice/), a book I had written which discusses the lived realities of Muslim women in Malaysia and the impact of current Islamic legal and cultural practices on our social, political, and economic lives. As a result, even when [the national religious authorities opened a formal criminal investigation into the book](https://maryamlee.com/jais-investigation-eng/), they have not moved forward with any charges. They have not found legitimate grounds for dismissal of the observations made in that book, which had been written based on lived realities. As the greatest boxer of his time, Muhammad Ali, reminded us [in his poem called “Truth”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USkZ6HvH4iI):

\
\


_...Facts are but its shadows,_

_Truth stands above all sin;_

_Great be the battle in life,_

_Truth in the end shall win..._

\


Try as we may to dismiss it, the truth will always be true. I have learned this to be proven many times over, and it has never failed me, either in work or personal life.&#x20;

\


Coming back to technological solutions, the reason it is so important to consider new paradigms is because we have thus far assumed that digital realities are the same as physical realities. This is an assumption that needs to be challenged. Failure to do so would render us calling a lawyer to fix a broken pipe. In order to be holistic in our approach to solving issues concerning digital rights violations, we must take into consideration **the reality of the digital economy**. Allow me to elaborate.

\


[Shoshana Zuboff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana\_Zuboff)’s [book](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/) on [surveillance capitalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIXhnWUmMvw) laid bare the political economy of the digital. In a capitalist economy, the market logic dictates that raw materials be translated into commodities that can be sold for money. In a furniture manufacturing plant, for example, raw materials are taken from the woods, go through some machines, and are turned into finished furniture for market actors to buy and sell. Now, in the digital economy, which is also operating within the capitalist economic system, **the raw materials are human experiences which are translated into data** (note that the digital is not just anything online; the digital consists of [anything that has been turned into binary codes](https://www.reference.com/history/digital-technology-93efbf266360578c)). Since our human experiences are the ones that are being put into these machines, we might be wondering what are the products that come out of it. The answer is that **the end products are prediction products**, which exist, among others, in the form of digital profiles. The more accurate the profile a tech company has on us, the more targeted we can be, the better advertisers can sell to us. The better advertisers can sell to us, the higher they pay to the tech company. As you can see from this business model, tech companies are financially rewarded to digitise more human bodies onto their platforms. The ability to increase and expand points of data collection is directly proportional to increased revenue, which is directly proportional to profits.

\


In our search for solutions, we must consider this reality, particularly on the mode of production of the digital economy. The reason why a lot of people do not understand this is because data is invisible. That is why [Zuboff’s book](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/) had been that phenomenal: she had made the invisible visible. With such an important revelation, a new paradigm on how we think about digital rights becomes necessary.&#x20;

\


Once we understand the underlying realities of the digital, we will see that what needs to happen is that **we need to regulate anything data**. This is because if our “solutions” to digital rights violations only focus on the machines, we will forever need to regulate any new machines that come into existence, which does not make sense. Allow me to use an analogy. In the automobile industry, we don't regulate BMWs, Mercedeses or Porsches, we regulate anything that is a box with an engine on four wheels. No matter what car manufacturer we spend our money on, we will always need [road safety regulations](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/strengthening-road-safety-legislation). Apart from that, a lot of the cybersecurity mechanisms we have today [are already standard requirements](https://www.cybersecurity.my/en/our\_services/iscb/main/detail/2327/index.html) in tech products, especially the newer ones that are more privacy conscious. However, it is my professional opinion that these are mere band-aids if they do not solve the problem of digital rights at the root.

\


Let’s talk about one example of a digital reality: **data entities do not concern themselves with any concepts of nationalism** nor do they care for any nationalist sentiments. In the digital realm, data is not constrained by physical borders, or borders of other kinds such as emotional/sentimental and spiritual ones. The only borders that data entities recognise are those that are technological. How then do we expect national data protection laws to actually protect entities that are not bound by national boundaries? We can quote jurisdictional authority all we want, or go to the highest courts of any land, but all malicious technologists have to do to bypass all that is to [transfer their business elsewhere to territories that are systematically more favourable to unlimited data harvesting and more enabling of data exploitation](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DTL/STI\_and\_ICTs/ICT4D-Legislation/eCom-Data-Protection-Laws.aspx). And because data entities don’t need to get on a plane to travel, threat actors could literally do all this from anywhere in the world.

\


But all is not lost. The good news in this particular instance is that transborder data flows can be configured technologically to protect data by a technology called [data encapsulation](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-for-beginners-what-is-encapsulation/). This technology allows for sending data where the data is augmented with successive layers of control information before transmission across a network, thus making them self-aware and therefore able to be programmed to observe national and international legislations. Imagine that: a world where data entities automatically observe data protection laws without everyone having to become computer scientists to exercise their right to data protection, or having access to a tech lawyer in case of a grievance. It’s like how we enjoy our right to access clean water without everyone having to become chemists or water plant engineers to ensure that the water is clean, or worry about fighting for our right to drinking water in court. Rights-protecting technologies take the burden of care away from users, allowing us to perform our non-technological roles in society without having to worry about whether or not our rights have been violated. Imagine [the amount of time and money that could be saved](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/litigation-costs.html) for more productive endeavors instead of spending them on righting the wrongs that never should have happened in the first place.

### Prevention is Better than Cure <a href="#id-77fcb18e-e549-4643-8df5-996607c79242" id="id-77fcb18e-e549-4643-8df5-996607c79242"></a>

The wisdom of prevention being better than cure is as old as time, but it never does get old. As kids, we were taught that we must eat our fruits and vegetables so that we wouldn’t have to see the doctor every so often. We say it, use it, sing it, memorise it: “[an apple a day keeps the doctor away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An\_apple\_a\_day\_keeps\_the\_doctor\_away)”. It would be a shame if we teach kids to be this proactive while we abandon this wisdom as adults. When did we become a society so dependent on remedy? How did we ever let it go this far?

\


Apart from the obvious, it is time that we recognise that **technology has the capacity to be configured in such a way that they observe human rights by design**. We won't need to go to the hospital if we are not sick in the first place. This does not mean that hospitals should not exist. Of course I am of the opinion that hospitals should exist, especially in case somebody gets accidentally stabbed by a knife. Instead, what needs to be acknowledged here is that as much as we are looking for a cure, we should be strengthening prevention measures as well. If we learned anything from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is that we should not be putting too much stress on the healthcare infrastructures to the point where they are overwhelmed. The very purpose of [flattening the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) is to buy enough time for healthcare facilities to respond effectively to each and every case of infection. That time between infection and medical attention is where the government plays a crucial role to intervene before debilitating death rates could even occur. The [high recovery rate (more than 80%)](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/covid19-weekly-roundup-recovery-rate-exceeds-80) from COVID-19 infections in countries like [Malaysia](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/covid19-malaysias-approach-may-have-contributed-low-death-high-recovery-rates-says-health-dg), for example, is evidence that this method works. Extending the knife analogy, technology could be configured in such a way that a knife stops functioning as a knife if the knife is intended for harm. However, this proactive approach requires technologists and humanitarian workers to work together in matters of technology governance. Just as how we let medical professionals lead us through a pandemic, we must let human-rights-conscious technologists lead us through a digital rights crisis.

### Conclusions <a href="#id-98269006-fba8-4fa5-954a-f77c2c47baf4" id="id-98269006-fba8-4fa5-954a-f77c2c47baf4"></a>

In what seems like a natural next step in human evolution, we should increase our efforts to explore more proactive and holistic approaches to digital rights advocacy. Principles of human rights as the ones stipulated in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) may be misunderstood as limiters to technological innovation. In reality, we do not have to give up our fundamental rights to enjoy advances in tech. It is more than possible to imagine a world where human rights and technological innovations co-exist, it is in fact already happening. This is where accountability mechanisms such as the [United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr\_en.pdf) could be applied to promote the need for social and humanitarian perspectives into the building and deployment of technologies. It is hoped that this multidisciplinary approach would be deemed necessary to bring humanity forward to the next frontier of digital civilisation.
